below command edits crontab for current user:
crontab -e 

to edit another user's cronjob use:
sudo crontab -u username -e

IMPORTANT:
use the fully file path of a command when executing a script via cron
reasons:
1 - security
2 - cron may run in a separate file environment that has different values for the PATH variable. specify full path so that it works no matter what

will add notes here later
